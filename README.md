# Lot-sizing-with-capacity-constraints
This program solves a lot of capacity-constrained problems. The inputs of the program can be defined as: • Demand (to be entered into the program as a python list) • Capacity (input for each period as a python list) • Setup costs for each batch. • Holding costs for each product. Within the framework of these inputs, the program is expected to give the best solution for each period. The program should first check if the problem is feasible. If the problem is feasible, it should solve the problem and print it on the screen as a list for each period.
